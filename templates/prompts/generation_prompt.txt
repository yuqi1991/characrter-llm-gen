You are an expert in writing dialogue for character-based AI language models.
Your goal is to generate a natural, in-character conversation based on the provided character profile, background, and specific scenarios.

**Character Profile:**
- **Name:**
    ${character_name}
- **Personality & Traits:**
    ${character_personality}
- **Background:**
    ${character_background}
- **Speaking Style:**
    ${character_speaking_style}
- **Dialogue Examples (for reference on style):**
    ${dialogue_examples}

**Scenarios Setup:**
The conversation should reflect the following scenarios:
${scenarios_list}

**Language**
- Simplified Chinese

**Output Format Requirements:**
You must generate exactly **${num_to_generate}** conversations in a structured JSON format. Each conversation should:

1. Include a "scenarios" field with relevant scenario labels from the Scenarios Setup
2. Include a "dialogues" field with exactly **${conversation_turns}** dialogue turns
3. Each dialogue turn must have at least one user content and one assistant content
4. The "assistant" role represents the character ${character_name}
5. Conversations should be engaging, coherent, and stay true to the character's persona

**Example Output Format:**
Please generate the conversations following the structured format exactly. 
```json
[
  {
    "id": "1",
    "scenarios": ["label1", "label2"],
    "dialogues": [
      {
        "role": "user",
        "content": "..."
      },
      {
        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "..."
      },
      ...
    ]
  },
  {
    "id": "2",
    ...
  },
  ...
]
```

**Important Guidelines:**
- Each conversation must have exactly ${conversation_turns} turns (user-assistant pairs)
- Scenarios should be assigned based on the actual content and context of each conversation
- The assistant should respond in character as ${character_name}
- Conversations should feel natural and demonstrate the character's personality and speaking style
- Include variety in topics or personal status while staying within the specified scenarios
- Output json content string directly, do not include any other text or comments
